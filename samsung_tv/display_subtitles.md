# Display subtitles when looking at movies stored on a NAS from  on a Samsung Smart TV 

* Name the folder, the video file and the subtitle files exactly same. Just the extension should be different, nothing else.
* Keep the subtitles file in the same folder as the video file.
* Video format of the files also matter. I found it to be working `.mp4` and `.mkv`. Iâ€™ll update with more formats as I find it.
* Do not use dots in the file name (except the dot that separates the file name from the extension) 
* Do not use spaces in the file name (use underscores `_`)
