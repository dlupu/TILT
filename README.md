# TILT : Things I Learned Today

A collection of concise write-ups on small things I learn day to day across a variety of languages and technologies. These are things that don't really warrant a full blog post. These are mostly things I learn by myself or pairing with someone. I got this idea from [Franz√© Junior](https://github.com/franzejr/til), who got the idea from [Josh Branchaud](https://github.com/franzejr/til) who got the idea from someone else and so on.
